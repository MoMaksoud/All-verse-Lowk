# 🔐 API Key Security - Cleanup Complete

## ✅ **Security Measures Implemented**

### 🗑️ **Removed Hardcoded API Keys**
- ✅ Removed Google Maps API key from all documentation files
- ✅ Cleaned up debug logs that could expose sensitive information
- ✅ Removed temporary debug components

### 🔒 **Environment Variable Security**
- ✅ API key is only loaded from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- ✅ `.env.local` is properly ignored by Git (already in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ No sensitive data will be committed to the repository

### 📁 **Files Cleaned**
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_SETUP.md` - Updated to use placeholder
- `src/lib/googleMaps.ts` - Removed debug logs
- `src/components/LocationAutocomplete.tsx` - Removed debug logs
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Removed debug component
- `src/components/LocationDebug.tsx` - Deleted entirely
- `LOCATION_AUTOCOMPLETE_FIX.md` - Deleted entirely

### 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**
1. **Environment Variables**: All API keys are loaded from environment variables only
2. **Git Ignore**: `.env.local` is ignored and won't be committed
3. **No Hardcoding**: No API keys are hardcoded in any source files
4. **Clean Logs**: Removed debug information that could expose sensitive data

### 📋 **For Team Members**
- Each developer needs to create their own `.env.local` file
- Use the `env.example` file as a template
- Never commit `.env.local` files to the repository
- API keys should be obtained from the project administrator

**✅ Your API keys are now secure and won't be exposed in the repository!**
